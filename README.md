# Phase 3 Project Guidelines

## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API. This project is a continuation of the phase-2 react project.

## Requirements

For this project, you must:

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

For example, build a todo list application with a React frontend interface and a
Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

- **Create** a new todo
- **Read** a list of all todos
- **Update** an individual todo
- **Delete** a todo

A `Todo` can be tagged with a `Category`, so that each todo _belongs to_ a category and each category _has many_ todos.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run `bundle install` to install the gems.

**Important**: Be sure you fork a copy of the repo into your GitHub account before cloning it. You can do this by using the link above or by clicking the "Octocat" button at the top of this page, then clicking "Fork" in the upper right corner of the repo page.

The `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file is used to input the routes for the project.

The server can be started with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port:
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

### Frontend Setup

### Fetch Example

Your React app should make fetch requests to your Sinatra backend! Here's an
example:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9292/test")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

## Project Tips

- This project is intended to focus more on the backend than the frontend, so try and keep the React side of things relatively simple. Focus on working with Active Record and performing CRUD actions. What are some interesting queries you can write? What kinds of questions can you ask of your data?
- Once you have a project idea, come up with a domain model and decide what relationships exist between the models in your application. Use a tool like [dbdiagram.io][] to help visualize your models.
- Decide on your API endpoints. What data should they return? What kind of CRUD action should they perform? What data do they need from the client?
- Use [Postman][postman download] to test your endpoints.
- Use `binding.pry` to debug your requests on the server. It's very helpful to use a `binding.pry` in your controller within a route to see what `params` are being sent.
- Use the [Network Tab in the Dev Tools][network tab] in the frontend to debug your requests.
